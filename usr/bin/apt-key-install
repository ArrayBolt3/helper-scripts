By Debian default, root rights are required to write to folder '/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d'.

Perhaps prepending 'sudo' would help? Consider:

sudo $0 $source_file $target_file" >&2
   exit 4
fi

gpg-dearmor "$source_file" "$target_file"

if ! test -r "$target_file" ; then
   echo "$0: ERROR: target_file '$target_file' not readable after writing!" >&2
   exit 6
fi

echo "$0: INFO: OK."
